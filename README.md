### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a business management administrator with a background in science who finally discovered programming and became a Software Engineer (best thing ever!). 


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
* [A project management app or "Team Todos" in React](https://santiagosalazarpavajeau.github.io/react-projects/#/projects)
* [A music-jam app in Vanilla Javascript](santiagosalazarpavajeau.github.io/chords_beats_frontend/)
* [A community for fellow young fathers in Ruby on Rails](https://pure-island-81017.herokuapp.com/)
* [Algorithms](https://github.com/SantiagoSalazarPavajeau/coding_challenges)


âš¡ Fun facts: ...
* I have a wonderfully smart 10 year old daughter that was born when I was 19.
* I wrote all the music and recorded all the instruments in Logic for my high school alternative rock band (over 10 years ago!) and then played the songs in the battle of the bands with some great friends.
* I have tons t-shirts and other merch on an e-commerce platform of amazon (IP free or original designs).
* I love mountains, outdoors, and hiking!
