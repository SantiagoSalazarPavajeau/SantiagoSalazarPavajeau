### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a business management administrator with a background in science who finally discovered programming and became a Software Engineer (best thing ever!). 


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
* [A project management app or "Team Todos" in React](https://santiagosalazarpavajeau.github.io/react-projects/#/projects)
* [A music-jam app in Vanilla Javascript](santiagosalazarpavajeau.github.io/chords_beats_frontend/)
* [A community for fellow young fathers in Ruby on Rails](https://pure-island-81017.herokuapp.com/)
* [Algorithms](https://github.com/SantiagoSalazarPavajeau/coding_challenges)


âš¡ Fun facts: ...
* I have a wonderfully smart 10 year old daughter that was born when I was 19.
* Before this I wrote and recorded an alt-rock album in Logic for our high school band (over 10 years ago!) and then played the songs in the battle of the bands with some great friends.
* Have hundrends of t-shirts and other merch over the internet from working on an e-commerce platform for amazon (IP free or original designs) while traveling.
* ðŸŒ± I love mountains, outdoors, and hiking!
